title: Introduction to Geospatial Data
description: >
  ## Summary

  This course offers a broad introduction into the use of geospatial data in data
  science applications.  The course will be highly focused on what makes
  geospatial data different from other types of data and what these differences
  imply for using and applying geospatial data.  The course materials will be
  built for non-geospatial professionals who find themselves needing to use
  geospatial data effectively.


  The availability and uses of geospatial data have been growing for decades.
  Recently, with the advent of robust web-mapping and dynamic client-side web
  tools many data analysts, applications programmers, web developers, and data
  scientists of all types have been confronted with geospatial data without
  having a background in geography or Geographic Information Systems (GIS).  This
  course will ground students in fundamental concepts of geospatial data science,
  geospatial computing, and geospatial applications so they can be more efficient
  and accurate in using geospatial data in their daily jobs. 
  What Participants Will Learn


  Students will learn how to:

    - Basics of map projections and the use of projected and un-projected geospatial
    data
    - How issues of scale, precision, and accuracy affect applications of geospatial
    data
    - Geospatial data models and the main ways geospatial data is presented in
    computer form
    - Key open-source and commercial off-the-shelf applications that handle
    geospatial data

prereqs: >
  Basic computer skills.  An understanding of tools such as spreadsheets, relational database management systems (RDMS), and programming will be beneficial, but not required.
