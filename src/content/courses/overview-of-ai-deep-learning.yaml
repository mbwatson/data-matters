title: Overview of AI and Deep Learning
description: >
  ## Summary

  There has been tremendous growth in AI over the past 10 years. Everyday we hear
  of challenging problems that are being solved using AI. At the same time we
  hear about the lack of explainability of decisions made by AI and about biases
  in AI models. Many of the key advances in AI are due to the advances in machine
  learning, especially deep learning. Natural language processing, computer
  vision, speech translation, biomedical imaging, and robotics are some of the
  areas that have benefited from deep learning methods. This course is designed
  to provide an overview of AI and in particular deep learning. We will look at
  the history of neural networks, how advances in data collection and computing
  have caused the revival in neural networks, the different types of deep
  learning networks and their applications, and tools and software available to
  design and deploy deep networks. The objective is to provide you with an
  overview, not necessarily to start coding and creating AI systems.


  This course is for those who are interested in understanding more about AI and
  deep learning, how they are used in different applications, and their
  advantages and disadvantages.  It is not meant to teach you about any of the
  deep learning frameworks or developing deep learning models.

  ## Core Topics

  The course will focus on the following topics:

    - History of neural networks
    - Neural networks as universal approximators
    - Training neural networks as an optimization problem
    - Deep neural networks
    - Why deep learning now?
    - Types of neural networks
    - Applications of deep learning and neural networks in image processing,
    natural language processing, robotics, computer vision, biomedical, and health
    care.
