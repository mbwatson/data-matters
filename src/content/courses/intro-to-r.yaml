  ## Summary

  Statistical programming is an integral part of many data-intensive careers and
  data literacy, and programming skills have become a necessary component of
  employment in many industries. This course begins with necessary concepts for
  new programmers—both general and statistical—and explores some necessary
  programming topics for any job that utilizes data. The R software package will
  be used as it is one of the most popular programs in statistics and data
  science. R programming is done in the RStudio integrated development
  environment.


  Data is everywhere. Every industry, and most careers, now involve working with
  data at some point. As data-driven decisions become the norm in many careers,
  individuals need to add to their professional skills by learning the essentials
  of programming.


  Whether their goal is to better communicate with coworkers who program or to
  integrate programming in their day-to-day jobs, this course benefits
  individuals who are looking to understand general principles behind statistical
  programming and to develop programming skills necessary to work in data-related
  areas.


  Even though computers are “literal,” programming offers many techniques for
  solving a particular problem. The combination of necessary precision and
  freedom of choice regarding techniques can be frustrating for beginners.

  ## Core Topics

  Covering both general computing concepts and an introduction to R, a general
  outline of the course is given below:

    - Day 1:
      + General computing concepts
      + Fundamental programming concepts
      + Introduction to R and RStudio
      + R functions
      + Common R data structures

    - Day 2:
      + R packages
      + Reading and writing data files (readr package)
      + Subsetting data by rows, columns, or both (dplyr package)
      + Deriving new variables unconditionally and conditionally (dplyr package)
      + Introduction to summarizing data

  This course aims to support individuals with little to no previous programming
  experience as they gain the fundamentals necessary to be successful
  programmers. No prior programming experience is expected in R or any other
  language. However, this course relies on active participation of the
  participants via hands-on programming. R and RStudio should be installed in
  advance so that participants can devote their time to practicing the skills
  from the course. Participants are provided instructions and resources in
  advance to assist with the installation process.
