title: Introduction to Big Data & Machine Learning for Survey Researchers & Social Scientists
description: >
  ## Summary

  In this course we explore how Big Data concepts, processes and machine learning
  methods can be used within the context of Survey and Social Science Research.
  Throughout this course we will illustrate key concepts using specific survey
  research examples including tailored survey designs and nonresponse adjustments
  and evaluation. 


  The amount of data generated as a by-product in society is growing fast
  including data from satellites, sensors, transactions, social media and
  smartphones, just to name a few. Such data are often referred to as “big data”,
  and can be used to create value in different areas such as health and crime
  prevention, commerce and fraud detection.  An emerging practice in many areas
  is to append or link big data sources with more specific and smaller scale
  sources that often contain much more limited information.  This practice has
  been used for some time by survey researchers in constructing frames by
  appending auxiliary information that is often not directly available on the
  frame, but can be obtained from an external source. Using Big Data has the
  potential to go beyond the sampling phase for survey researchers and in fact
  has the potential to influence the social sciences in general.  Big Data is of
  interest for public opinion researchers and agencies that produce statistics to
  find alternative data sources either to reduce costs, to improve estimates or
  to produce estimates in a more timely fashion. However, Big Data pose several
  interesting and new challenges to survey researchers and social scientists
  among others who want to extract information from data. As Robert Groves (2012)
  pointedly commented, the era is “appropriately called Big Data and not Big
  Information”, because there is a lot of work for analysts before information
  can be gained from “auxiliary traces of some process that is going on in
  society.”  As we embark on the fourth era of survey research we will see more
  use of big data within the survey research process as well as increased use of
  machine learning methods to process and analyze these data.

  ## Core Topics

  This course will offer participants:

    - an overview of key big data terminology and concepts
    - a discussion of some primary issues with linking big data with survey
    data
    - a discussion of the opportunities for big data within the survey research
    process
    - a discussion of the opportunities for survey data within the big data
    ecosystem
    - issues of coverage and measurement errors within the big data context
    - a discussion of information extraction and signal detection in the context of
    big data
    - a discussion of the similarities and differences in model building for
    inference versus prediction
    - a discussion of how to visualize massive amounts of data
    - an overview of four popular machine learning methods including k-means
    clustering, hierarchical clustering, classification and regression trees and
    random forests using R with example code provided
    - an introduction to the Rattle package that provides a graphical user
    interface for machine learning within the R environment
    - a discussion and illustration about how these and other methods can be used
    in the survey research process

  ## Course Outline

    - An overview of big data, it’s potential, perils and total error
    framework.

    activities
    - K-Means clustering

  ### Day 2:

    - K-means clustering, cont.
    - Hierarchical clustering
    - k-nearest neighbors

    - Introduction to the Rattle package in R

prereqs: >
  The course is aimed at both producers and users of survey data as well as
  social scientists who want to learn machine learning methods that can be used
  within the broader context of social science data. The course is aimed equally
  at researchers and students from academia, government and the voluntary and
  private sector and is appropriate for researchers new to this topic who have
  some familiarity with survey research concepts such as responsive/tailored
  survey designs, measurement error, nonresponse bias and data linkage.
  Familiarity with model building and model selection as well as the R program is
  not required but could also be helpful.  While this course is not intended to
  teach participants machine learning via R, we will explore four common machine
  learning algorithms and provide R code and output to illustrate these methods
  within the context of the R language.
