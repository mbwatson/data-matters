title: Introduction to Effective Information Visualization
description: >
  ## Summary

  Participants will see how freely and commonly available software can be used to
  create effective visualizations; learn how to clean and re-structure data; and
  learn basic effective visualization principles so you can go beyond the
  defaults and create eye-catching and impactful figures!


  Visualization is a powerful way to reveal patterns in data, attract attention,
  and get your message across to an audience quickly and clearly.  However, there
  are many steps in that journey from information to influence, and many
  questions â€“ what visualization tools to use, how to get data into the right
  format, and which choices to make when putting it all together to tell your
  story? This course will quickly walk participants through a wide variety of
  data and chart types to help even beginners feel comfortable embarking on a new
  visualization project.

  ## Core Topics

  The course will cover five major topic areas during the eight time blocks over
  two days. Sessions will combine lecture and hands-on activities in data
  cleaning, transformation, and visualization.

    - Tips for effective data visualization and graphic design (2 course
    modules)
    - Charts, maps, and interactive dashboards with Tableau (3 course modules)
    - Cleaning and re-structuring data using OpenRefine (1 course module)
    - Free web-based tools such as RAW for less-common visualization types
    - Critique of existing visualizations and information graphics

prereqs: >
  This course is designed at an introductory level but will assume a basic
  understanding of spreadsheets as a way of storing and processing data. No
  programming will be necessary. Note that the Tableau training starts at a very
  introductory level, so if you are already an advanced user, that particular
  content may feel basic to you.


  Before class, please install recent versions of Tableau (Public or Desktop), a
  web browser, and OpenRefine in order to participate in the hands-on
  computer-based activities. Please have software installed before class. We will
  not be spending time on that during the day.
