  Siobahn is the first woman computer science Ph.D. graduate from North Carolina
  Agricultural and Technical State University (2018). She is an Assistant
  Professor and Program Director of Information Science/Systems in the School of
  Library and Information Sciences at North Carolina Central University, Lab
  Director for the Laboratory for Artificial Intelligence and Equity Research
  (LAIER), Co-Director for the Center fOr Data Equity (CODE), an AAAS IF/THEN
  ambassador, and an Office e-Learning faculty fellow at North Carolina Central
  University. Her research focuses on utilizing machine learning to identify
  sources of misinformation on social media and on improving fault detection in
  autonomous vehicles.

  Dr. Grady advocates increasing the number of women and minorities in computer
  science. She believes that “the STEM workforce has both gender disparities and
  that of historically disenfranchised groups. As an AAAS IF/THEN ambassador, she
  affects change by examining girls’ perceptions, attitudes, and behaviors,
  helping them gain confidence in curating and developing a STEM identity.”
