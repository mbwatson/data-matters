title: Visualization in Data Science using R
description: >
  ## Summary

  This course is designed for two audiences: experienced visualization designers
  looking to apply open data science techniques to their work, and data science
  professionals who have limited experience with visualization.  Participants
  will develop skills in visualization design using R, a tool commonly used for
  data science. Basic familiarity with R is required.


  Data science skills are increasingly important for research and industry
  projects. With complex data science projects, however, come complex needs for
  understanding and communicating analysis processes and results.  Ultimately, an
  analyst’s data science toolbox is incomplete without visualization skills.
  Incorporating effective visualizations directly into the analysis tool you are
  using can facilitate quick data exploration, streamline your research process,
  and improve the reproducibility of your research.

  ## Core Topics

  The course will take a project-based approach to learning best practices for
  visualization for data science.  Participants will be guided through several
  sample analysis and visualization projects that will highlight different types
  of visualization, different features of R and its visualization capabilities,
  and different challenges that arise when trying to apply an open data science
  philosophy to visualization.

    - Introduction to visualization in R 
    - Using ggplot2 for publication-ready graphics
    - Applying common graphic design principles to ggplot2 visualizations
    - Adding interactivity to visualizations through R Markdown and HTML widgets

prereqs: >
  As indicated above, this course assumes basic familiarity with R—e.g., R
  syntax, data structures, development environments. Participants with no
  knowledge of R should consider taking an introductory R short course prior to
  this class.


  We will use RStudio to interact with R, and all exercises will be distributed
  in R Markdown files (rather than simple R script files). This allows us to
  combine R code with non-code elements and promotes a literate programming
  approach to research.


  A significant portion of the course will use ggplot2 and other tidyverse
  packages to create visualizations, but prior experience with those packages is
  not required.  In order to participate in class exercises, participants should
  have installed current versions of R, RStudio, and the following packages:
  tidyverse, markdown, knitr, readxl, plotly, maps, mapproj, and sf. Permissions
  to install packages on the fly will be useful.
