title: Introduction to Statistical Machine Learning in R
description: >
  ## Summary

  Statistical machine learning and data mining is an interdisciplinary research
  area which is closely related to statistics, computer sciences, engineering,
  and bioinformatics. Many statistical machine learning and data mining
  techniques and algorithms are useful in various scientific areas. This 2-day
  short course will provide an overview of statistical machine learning and data
  mining techniques with applications to the analysis of real data. Both
  supervised and unsupervised techniques will be covered.


  Supervised learning techniques include penalized regression such as LASSO and
  its variants, support vector machines and tree-based methods.


  Unsupervised learning techniques include dimension reduction methods such as
  principal components analysis and clustering analysis. The main emphasis will
  be on the analysis of real data sets from various scientific fields. The
  techniques discussed will be demonstrated in R.


  This course is intended for researchers who have some knowledge of statistics
  and would like to be introduced to statistical machine learning and data mining
  as well as for practitioners who would like to apply statistical machine
  learning techniques to their problems. Machine learning plays an increasingly
  significant role in data science and has become an integral part of many
  fieldsâ€”from biomedicine to business/marketing to social media. It is grounded
  directly in our daily lives.

  ## Core Topics

prereqs: >
  Participants should be familiar with linear regression and basic statistical
  and probability concepts, as well as familiarity with R programming.  R and R
  Studio should be installed before class.
