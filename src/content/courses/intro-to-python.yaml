description: >
  ## Summary

  Learning Python is important for any aspiring data scientist who is interested
  in programming as a skill, a discipline, and a profession.


  This course will serve as a foundation for students seeking to use programming
  as a tool in their data science tool belt. This course will help students
  evaluate, communicate with, and work with programmers or code. Participants
  will get hands-on practice with creating and manipulating data sets. At an
  introductory level, participants will learn to create programs that manipulate
  data, perform error handling, and store and retrieve data using relational
  databases.

  ## Core Topics

  Students will learn how to:

    - create programs that manipulate data
    - perform error handling
    - store and retrieve data using relational databases
    - use the pandas library, the de facto standard to work with tabular data in
    Python

  Participants will need to be skilled in basic mathematics and algebra as well
  as e-mail and web usage. They will also, of course, need a computer to
  participate in the hands-on exercises.
